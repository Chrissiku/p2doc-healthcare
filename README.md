# 🩺 P2Doc Healthcare
> P2Doc is a platform that leverages the power of Web5 to ensure a secure sharing of medical records between patients and doctors, hence the name P2Doc, signifying Patient-to-Doctor interaction

## 🪧 Problem statement
Numerous individuals have faced unfortunate consequences due to the absence of a secure means through which their medical records can be confidentially shared. Maintaining the confidentiality of medical information, even when shared over the internet, remains a critical concern. When examining previous web technologies, such as Web2 and Web3, which are centralized, it becomes apparent that users' data is stored by third-party entities, leaving it vulnerable to exposure by malicious actors. Hence, we conceived the idea of concealing the sharing of medical records between doctors and patients by harnessing the power of decentralized technology (Web5).

## ⚙ Key features
The application offers the following key features:
- **Profile Creation:** 
  Both doctors and patients can easily create and manage their profiles based on their user type.

- **Doctor Dashboard:** 
  Doctors have access to a dedicated dashboard where they can view incoming requests from onboarded patients.

- **Appointment Management:** 
  Doctors can efficiently manage appointments, including viewing recently booked appointments.

- **Medical Record Management:** 
  Doctors can write and manage medical records securely within the platform.

- **Patient Appointment Booking:** 
  Patients can conveniently book appointments with their preferred doctors through the platform.

- **Medical Record Access:** 
  Patients can easily access and view their medical records, ensuring transparency and convenience.
